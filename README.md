## Download

This app is in early development and might have breaking changes. To try it out, [contact @zetavg](#contact) for the `.apk` file for Android or TestFlight installation for iOS.


## Build

The app is written with React Native (TypeScript), with native modules written in Java and Objective-C to handle UART/Bluetooth communications and full-text searching.

The source code is not ready for public release yet. I still need some time to check and remove sensitive information from the repo. If you are interested in the development, please [contact @zetavg](#contact).
